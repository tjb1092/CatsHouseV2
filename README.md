# Welcome to the Cat's House

This is hopefully the final attempt at making an e-commerce site designed to act as a marketplace/boutique to provide unique items for cat lovers. We didn't want to use a traditional wordpress framework or high-level helper like OpenCart for an educational experience as well as more fine-tune control of the User Experience.  

It uses the following technologies:
+ SCSS
+ Handlebars + Emmet
+ Bootstrap 4
+ NodeJS
+ Express
+ MongoDB + Mongoose
+ Passport + Bcrypt.js
+ Stripes
+ JS + JQuery
